Top Down Design - How to Become a Turing Student


1. Applying to Turing
  1.1. Go to computer
  1.2 Log on
  1.3 Open Web Browser
  1.4 In Google Type Turing
  1.5 Find Turing School of Software and Design Website from results(turing.io)
    1.5.1 Click on correct link (turing.io)
  1.6 From Turing Website Select Programs
    1.6.1 Click on Programs Tab in right hand corner of navigation menu
  1.7 Select Program
    1.7.1 Select FrontEnd Program
    1.7.2 Select BackEnd Programs
  1.8 Click on apply that is associate with selected Program
  1.9 Submit Resume
    1.9.1 Attach Resume to application
  1.10 Take Logic Quiz
    1.10.1 Take logic quiz by selecting answer you believe to be logically sound based on question
  1.11 If resume and logic quiz results pass go to step 2

2. Conduct PreScreening Interview
  2.1 Schedule time to take PreScreening Interview
    2.1.1 From calendar scheduling app select a day and time to meet that works for your schedule
      2.1.1.1 Works for your schedule would be not other scheduling conflicts and is available for interviewer
  2.2 On selected day and time arrive to Turing School or Open computer if virtual interviewer
  2.3 Discuss work history, personal qualities, take second logic Quiz
    2.3.1 Tell the experience of prior jobs
    2.3.2 Tell qualities of who you are as a person
      2.3.2.1 Open Minded(T/F), Caring(T/F), AbletoWorkwithOthers(T/F)
    2.3.3 Take second logic assessment
      2.3.3.1 Select answers that you think are correct based on question parameters
        2.3.3.1.1 If stuck ask interviewer for help
  2.4 If PreScreening Interview results pass go to step 3

3. Select your cohort and pay tuition
    3.1 Once you are accepted into program you must select what cohort you would like to start
      3.1.1 From calendar options when cohorts will begin program curriculum select cohort
    3.2 To enter into cohort and begin mod 0 you must pay tuition
      3.2.1 Tuition = 20,000
    3.3. Once cohort selected and tuition paid go to step 4

4. Begin and Pass MOD 0
  4.1 Attend weekly session of MOD 0
    4.1.1 Have computer and login with zoom at designated date and time
  4.2 Complete all homework assignments, tasks, and readings.
    4.2.1 If stuck asks your fellow cohort members first, then ask instructors
  4.3 Complete all sessions and take Technical assessment

5. Complete Capstone
  5.1 After enrolling in program work on Capstone assignments
  5.2 Capstone is designed to be completed over 7 days (~30 hours)
  5.3 From assigned readings complete days assigned in gist
  5.4 When all days and assignments are done, and all facets of capstone completed submit capstone
  5.5 When steps 4 and 5 are completed and results are Turing Ready go to step 6

6. Become a Turing Student
  6.1 You will have become a Turing Student when all prior steps have been completed

7. Be sure to look at Checklist before pushing changes to GitHub
